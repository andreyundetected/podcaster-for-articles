I am providing you with a PDF image of a scientific article. Extract the text accurately while considering the column structure of the document. For any non-textual elements such as images, graphs, or charts, use the placeholder {PHOTO DESCRIPTION: detailed description of the figure or graph}. Ensure that all formulas are written in plain ASCII without using any LaTeX formatting. Output the extracted text in a simple and readable format, keeping only ASCII characters.
