# podcaster for articles
Automatic translation of pdf/txt scientific articles into audio podcasts/lectures

1. Download requirements.txt
2. Write your OpenAI API key in the .env file
3. Upload scientific articles in pdf format or article text in txt format to the Input folder
4. Select the settings that suit you in the settings.txt file
5. Run CODE/main.py
6. The text and audio of the articles are in the output folder


This is a prototype that I am going to develop.

The idea is to make an app for your phone where you can read articles, make podcasts out of them, listen to them in the background, ask questions to the AI ​​about these articles, and so on. In general, make studying articles easier and more enjoyable.

So, you can support me in developing this project
